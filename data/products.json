Instead of driving countless miles or making educated guesses, investors can now efficiently locate opportunities at scale through intelligent, data-driven search capabilities.\n\nFor value-added investors, Casafy represents a breakthrough in off-market property discovery. The platform is the first of its kind to identify distressed properties based on their physical condition, powered by a proprietary AI model that analyzes street-level data across North America. This technology enables investors to pinpoint properties with renovation potential or condition-based indicators that traditional listing services simply cannot capture, giving them a significant competitive advantage in finding lucrative investment opportunities before they become widely known in the market.",
