          "answer": "Common compliance risks include lease violations, environmental contamination (Phase I/II issues), ADA non-compliance, building code violations, zoning non-conformance, fair housing violations, and insurance lapses. The specific risks depend on your property type, location, and tenant mix."

          "answer": "AI-powered lease review can reduce initial review time by 50-80%, which translates to significant legal fee savings on portfolio acquisitions. For a 50-property portfolio acquisition, this could save $50,000-200,000 in legal fees. Compliance monitoring tools prevent costly violations that can run into six or seven figures."

      "buyer_tip": "Legal tech in CRE is still maturing. Before committing to any platform, run a real test: feed it actual leases from your portfolio and compare the output against what your attorneys find. Pay attention not just to what the tool catches, but what it misses \u2014 a tool that gives you false confidence about legal compliance is worse than no tool at all."

In a post-pandemic world where hybrid work has fundamentally changed office utilization patterns, these tools have become essential for making informed decisions about your real estate footprint.\n\nThese platforms combine space planning capabilities (floor plan design, move management, furniture inventory) with occupancy analytics (sensor data, badge swipes, booking patterns) to give facilities teams and corporate real estate leaders a complete picture of how space is actually used versus how it was designed to be used.\n\nFor CRE professionals on both sides of the table, understanding space utilization is critical. Landlords need to design buildings that attract tenants in a hybrid world. Corporate occupiers need to right-size their portfolios and create workplaces that people actually want to come to.",

Post-pandemic, many hybrid offices see 30-50% average utilization with significant day-of-week variation (Tuesday-Thursday typically highest). The 'right' rate depends on your workplace strategy \u2014 but if you're below 40%, you likely have an opportunity to reduce or reconfigure space."

If you're redesigning your workplace strategy, you need deeper sensing and analytics. Match the tool's capability to your actual decision-making needs, not to a theoretical ideal."
